# ðŸ”” Notifications Microservice

## ðŸŽ™ Introduction

The idea of â€‹â€‹the project is to create a microservice that uses [Kafka](https://kafka.js.org/) to handle asynchronous messages from others applications. In addition to understand more about the concept of microservices I could learn more about the [Nest](https://nestjs.com/) framework, understanding more about the concepts of dependency injection and dependency inversion. I learned more about some other patterns like mappers, value objects, view models, single responsibility principle. And finally, the methodology used is TDD with more one pattern, the in memory database.

This project was created in Ignite Lab, a event of [Rocketseat](https://www.rocketseat.com.br/).
